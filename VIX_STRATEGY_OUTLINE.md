# VIX-Enhanced DCA Investment Strategy

## Core Strategy Overview

Split annual investment capital: **80% for regular DCA + 20% for opportunistic buying**

### The 80% - Regular DCA
- Divide into 12 equal monthly purchases
- Buy every month regardless of market conditions
- Invest in diversified ETFs (e.g., VTI, XEQT, VFV, etc.)
- This ensures you're always in the market

### The 20% - Fear Reserve Fund
- Keep in high-yield savings account
- Deploy ONLY when VIX hits predetermined thresholds
- This is your "buy the dip" ammunition

## VIX-Triggered Buy Rules

### Graduated Buying Strategy

| VIX Level | Action | Rationale |
|-----------|--------|-----------|
| **25-29** | Buy 0.5 months worth | Elevated fear - small dip |
| **30-39** | Buy 1 month worth | High fear - meaningful dip |
| **40-49** | Buy 2 months worth | Extreme fear - significant dip |
| **50+** | Buy 3 months worth | Panic - rare opportunity |

### Important Rules

1. **30-Day Cooldown:** After any VIX-triggered purchase, wait 30 days before buying again (prevents burning through reserve too quickly during extended volatility)

2. **Maximum One Buy Per Month:** Even if VIX crosses multiple thresholds, only execute one VIX-triggered buy per month

3. **Replenishment:** At start of each year, rebuild the 20% reserve from new investment capital

## Why This Works

**Psychological Advantages:**
- Removes emotion from decision-making
- No guessing the bottom
- Systematic rules you can stick to
- Still buying regularly (no market timing)

**Mathematical Advantages:**
- Buying more when prices are typically lower
- Dollar-cost averaging during normal times
- Extra capital deployed during fear spikes
- Compound growth from high-yield savings when not deployed

**Risk Management:**
- Never fully out of the market (80% deployed)
- Never fully exposed at one time
- Dry powder for real opportunities
- Diversified entry points

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Calm Year (VIX stays below 25)
- Deploy all 80% monthly as planned
- Reserve stays in high-yield savings earning interest
- At year-end, reserve rolls into next year

### Scenario 2: Moderate Volatility (VIX hits 30-35 twice)
- Deploy all 80% monthly as planned
- Buy 1 month worth in March (VIX: 32)
- Buy 1 month worth in October (VIX: 34)
- Total deployed: 80% + 2 months = ~97% of capital

### Scenario 3: Market Crash (VIX hits 45 in March, 55 in April)
- Deploy all 80% monthly as planned
- Buy 2 months in March (VIX: 45)
- Wait 30 days (cooldown)
- Buy 3 months in May (VIX: 55)
- Total deployed: 80% + 5 months = 121% (borrowed from next year)

## Annual Review Questions

1. Did I stick to the rules? (no emotional overrides?)
2. How much of the 20% reserve was deployed?
3. Were my VIX-triggered buys profitable long-term?
4. Should I adjust my VIX thresholds? (based on experience)
5. Do I need to adjust my 80/20 split?

## Key Principles to Remember

✓ **Discipline over emotion** - Follow the rules even when scared
✓ **Time in market > timing market** - 80% always working
✓ **Fear is your friend** - High VIX = buying opportunity
✓ **Patience pays** - Cooldown prevents overtrading
✓ **Stay diversified** - Use broad market ETFs
✓ **Long-term focus** - This is a multi-year strategy

## Red Flags to Avoid

✗ Deviating from thresholds because "it feels different this time"
✗ Skipping regular DCA to save for bigger dips
✗ Ignoring cooldown periods
✗ Using emergency fund for extra buying
✗ Panic selling during volatility
✗ Overcomplicating with too many rules

## Strategy Variations to Consider (Optional)

**Conservative:** 
- 85% DCA / 15% reserve
- Higher VIX thresholds (30/40/50)

**Aggressive:**
- 70% DCA / 30% reserve
- Lower VIX thresholds (20/30/40)

**Price-Based Hybrid:**
- Add rule: "Also buy if S&P 500 down 10%+ from recent high"
- Combines volatility and actual price drops

---

Remember: This strategy is designed for **long-term wealth building** (10+ years). Short-term results will vary. Stick to the system, and let compound growth do the heavy lifting.
